# caesar-cipher
This is a simple program that can apply a Caesar Cipher to a text input file.
I have always enjoyed cracking codes and ciphers, so I thought I would make a program that can do a simple Caesar Cipher.
I am hoping to be able to add this to a website in the future along with other ciphers for people to play around with.
